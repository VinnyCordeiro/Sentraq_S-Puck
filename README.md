# Sentraq_S-Puck
Let's make an April's Fool prank true!

On April 1st, 2017, our friend Joshua Young from Sentraq announced the creation of the Sentraq S-Puck keyboard, a 21-switch circular keyboard.

But the joke is too good to let it restricted to an April's Fool prank, so I'm going to make it real!

All files of this repository are released in the public domain, go wild on them!

## Updates:
April 2, 2017: Released CAD files for sandwich-style 120mm diameter circular case (that's the size of a regular CD/DVD). Keep in mind that I've made them in about 30 minutes, it's possible there is something wrong with them. I've tested them with the Big Blue Saw online quote tool, though, and they should be fine. I'm designing to use M3 screws, they come with every computer case and are easy to source, you'll probable just need some M3 standoffs.
